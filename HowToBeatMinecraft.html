						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">Preparing for Caves</h3>
						<p>When you first create a survival world, <strong>before anything else</strong>, you should gather wood from trees of any type.<br>
						Once you gather about 5 logs, turn them into planks by pressing E to open your inventory and placing them in the<br> 
						crafting area. Once you've done that, create a crafting table by filling the previously mentioned crafting area<br>
						with planks. After this is done, follow the recipes shown in the images below.</p>
						<img src="https://www.digminecraft.com/basic_recipes/images/make_stick.png" height="240" width="240" alt="Two wood planks stacked vertically in any position" />
						<img src="https://www.digminecraft.com/tool_recipes/images/make_wooden_pickaxe.png" height="240" width="240" alt="Two vertically placed sticks in the center,
						three horizontally placed planks along the top" />
					
						<p>Immediately after obtaining the pickaxe, break the blocks beneath you <em>(in most biomes)</em> to go underground<br>
						and acquire cobblestone, which you can use to create tools using the recipes shown in the video below.</p>
						<video src="craftingTools.webm" type="video/webm" height="240" width="240" controls>Video not supported.</video>
					
						<p>At this point, your priority should be getting food. The most common mobs that drop food are <strong>pigs, cows, chickens, and sheep.</strong><br>
						There are other sources of food, but for now, prioritize these.</p>
						
					</span>
					
					<span id="exploringCaves">
						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">Exploring Caves</h3>
						<p>Now, it's time to find a cave. Caves are where ores are acquired, which you can use to create stronger armor and tools.<br>
						It's best to understand how to craft armor without consulting the recipe book, which can be found to the left of the<br>
						crafting HUD. Armor recipes can be seen in the video below.</p>
						<video src="craftingArmor.webm" type="video/webm" height="240" width="240" controls>Video not supported.</video>
					
						<p>At this point, it's been a while since you started your world. You're probably a bit hungry, but you've got food. The only<br>
						issue is that it's raw, right? Worry not, for the most common resources that caves yield are cobblestone and coal, which are<br>
						the two materials it takes to craft and operate a furnace. Using your stone pickaxe, acquire about a stack of coal (stack = 64)<br>
						and arrange 8 cobblestone blocks along the outer ends of the crafting HUD to create a furnace. As shown in the image below<br>
						to smelt items in a furnace, place your fuel in the bottom space, and that which you wish to smelt in the top space. Using<br>
						the furnace, cook your food. Later, you will smelt iron and gold using the furnace.</p>
						<img src="https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/images/15891664265eb8c15a37231.png" height="200" width="240" alt="Furnace crafting hud,
						as previously described" />
					
						<p>Now that you've got cooked food and you know how to use a furnace, it's time to descend. Some caves stop at dead ends, so<br>
						it's up to you to find one that goes deep enough to find the ores you're looking for. Diamonds, the most valuable ore that can<br>
						be found in the overworld, are most common at Y-coordinate 12 (You can enable coordinates in your settings). As you descend the<br>
						cave, you'll encounter a multitude of dangerous creatures. There are creepers, which explode when standing close to you for a<br>
						period of time, there are skeletons, which shoot you with bows and arrows, and there are zombies, which slowly walk towards you<br>
						to attack you.</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>After you've got your coal, mine iron ore, smelt it, and make full iron armor before anything else. This will guarantee you to<br>
						survive the deadly creeper explosion, which can instantly kill you if you've got nothing to protect you and easily end your<br>
						world early on. Make iron tools using the recipes shown previously, but using iron ingots in place of cobblestone. Descend towards<br>
						Y-coordinate 12, and use the ore rarity table shown below.</p>

						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">Preparing for the Nether</h3>
						<p>After spending some time in the lower regions of a cave, you'll likely have acquired yourself some valuable materials.<br>
						After you've finished gathering ores in a cave, the next step is to go to the nether. To do this, you will need to build<br>
						a nether portal, as can be seen in the image below.</p>
						<img src="https://www.digminecraft.com/getting_started/images/how_to_make_nether_portal3.png" height="240" width="240" />
					
						<p>A <strong>Nether Portal</strong> is simply comprised of 10 obsidian blocks placed in a specific shape. As you can see in the image,<br>
						the player is holding a flint and steel, which can be crafted by placing an iron ingot and a filnt, which can be acquired<br>
						by breaking gravel, in any particular order in the crafting HUD. This is because the portal must be lit with a fire charge<br>
						in order to activate. There are two ways to build a nether portal. At this point in the game, obsidian can only be mined with<br>
						a diamond pickaxe. Using one, you can mine 10 obsidian, build the shape of the portal shown in the image above, and light it <br>
						with the flint and steel. The other way to build the portal is to use water and lava buckets. When flowing water touches a lava<br>
						source block, it creates obsidian. Taking advantage of this, you can create a nether portal, as is demonstrated in the video below.</p>

						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">Locating the Fortress</h3>
						<p>You may be wondering why you must go to the Nether in order to complete the game. The End dimension is, as the name would<br>
						suggest, the last dimension the player must complete in order to beat Minecraft. More about the End dimension will be<br>
						explained later on in the guide, but for now, all you need to know is that there is an item that you must obtain within<br>
						the Nether in order to get to the End, and that item is the blaze rod. Blaze rods are dropped by the blaze mob, which can<br>
						be found in <strong>Nether Fortresses</strong> Blazes are shown in the image below.</p>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/b/b8/BlazeNoParticles.png/revision/latest?cb=20190512021145" height="240" 
						width="240" alt="Nether fortress" />
						
						<p>Many biomes are found in the Nether, as of update 1.16. These include the Nether Wastes, the Soul Sand Valley, the Crimson Forest,<br>
						the Warped Forest, and the Basalt Deltas. Each biome hosts a different variety of mobs, but for now, because we only care about<br>
						completing the game, we'll just focus on finding the Fortress, which can be found in all biomes. There's no trick to finding it,<br>
						you've just got to search around the Nether until you happen to come accross it. The Nether Fortress can be seen in the image below.</p>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/c/cb/Nether_Fortress.png/revision/latest?cb=20200415083830" height="240" width="240

					<span id="insideTheFortress">
						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">Inside the Fortress</h3>
						<p>The Nether Fortress is a dangerous place to be. It's the only place in the entirety of the game where both blazes and<br>
						wither skeletons spawn, which are two of the most dangerous mobs a player can encounter. Both apply damage-over-time<br>
						effects in the form of withering and burning, which can make quick work of a player when coupled with the fact that these <br>
						mobs tend to attack in groups, meaning that you'll almost always be afflicted with one of these harmful ailments. The best<br>
						way to deal with these mobs is to use a shield, which you can place in your offhand by hovering over it in your inventory<br>
						and pressing the F key. The crafting recipe for shields can be seen below. Because the Nether Fortress comprises of narrow<br>
						hallways, more often than not, if you're being overwhelmed by dangerous mobs, you can block them off.</p>
						<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/c4/a5/e8c4a5668d4a6acaf1cdbaebfaf3a2a5.png" height="240" width="240" alt="Shield crafting recipe" />
						
						<p>Now that you know how to deal with these dangerous mobs, let's talk loot, because there's some great loot to be found<br>
						in these fortresses. The most valuable items that can be found in the Nether Fortress, besides blazes rods, are diamond,<br>
						saddles, and horse armor. Saddles do not have a crafting recipe as of 1.16, so the only other two means of obtaining <br>
						them are through dungeons and ravagers during village raids. The two most worthwhile uses for saddles are horses and<br>
						striders, but in this guide, we won't be delving too far into that. Nether fortresses are also the only places in the<br>
						game in which nether warts can be found.</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>Back to the main idea: as mentioned before, the Nether Fortress is where you can acquire blaze rods. Once again,<br>
						blaze rods are dropped by the blaze mob, which can be found scattered about the fortress, but the easiest way to get<br>
						all of the blaze rods is to find the blaze spawner and kill them as they spawn. Blaze rods have about a 50% chance of<br>
						dropping from blazes on kill, and you want about 12 rods. In the next section of the guide, the reason you needed<br>
						blaze rods in the first place will be explained.</p>

						<p>This is the final stretch, but there is a lot of preparing to do before you can go to the End and fight the dragon.<br>
						Before anything else, you need to have the <strong>Eye of Ender</strong> in order to be able to locate the <strong>Stronghold</strong>,<br>
						the naturally occuring structure in the overworld, found deep underground, in which the <strong>End Portal</strong> lies.<br>
						The End dimension, as you can see in the image below, consists of one large island outlined by 10 obsidian pillars, with<br>
						an <strong>End Crystal</strong> sitting at the top of each. These crystals heal the dragon with such efficiency that it<br>
						isn't even worth attacking the dragon until each one is destroyed. Luckily, they're fairly easy to break, so long as you<br>
						come to the fight with a bow and plenty of arrows. Some of the crystals are protected by <strong>Iron Bars,</strong> but<br>
						the player can shoot arrows from beneath said bars in order to hit the crystals.</p>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft/images/5/5c/The_End.png/revision/latest?cb=20200329222338" height="300" width="480" 
						alt="The End Dimension" />
						
						<p>As you would probably expect, the End dimension is home to Endermen. Endermen are neutral mobs that become hostile<br>
						upon either being hit, or being looked at directly in the eyes. While fighting the Ender Dragon, it can be hard not to<br>
						accidentally aggravate endermen, even though you'll be looking upwards for the most part. One item you could consider<br>
						bringing is the <strong>Carved Pumpkin</strong>, which allows you to look at endermen without aggravating them. This isn't ideal,<br>
						however, because wearing a carved pumpkin both obscures your vision and occupies your helmet slot. The most important<br>
						item to bring is a <strong>Water Bucket</strong>. Essentially, you'll use it to break your fall when the dragon uses<br>
						its wing attack to throw you into the air. This requires timing and practice, so keep that in mind before going to the End.</p>
					</span>
					
					<span id="theStronghold">
						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">The Stronghold</h3>
						<p>Before you can locate the Stronghold, you need to acquire<br>
						12 enderpearls at the bare minimum. You've already been through the Nether, so you have more than enough blaze rods.<br>
						Take the blaze rods, put them in the crafting hud with nothing else, and you'll create blaze powder. Combine<br>
						blaze powder and ender pearls in no particular order, and you'll create <strong>Eyes of Ender.</strong></p>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/7/7a/Eye_of_Ender_JE2_BE2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/160?cb=20200323024859"
						height="240" width="240" alt="Eye of Ender" />
						
						<p>Once you have at least 12 eyes of Ender and you're fully prepared to take on the dragon, throw an eye by hovering<br>
						over it in your inventory and right clicking. The eye will float in the direction of the Stronghold, and from there,<br>
						you just follow it. Each time you throw an Eye of Ender, there is a 1/5 chance of it breaking, which is why you may<br>
						have wanted more than 12 eyes. If you throw the eye while you're above the stronghold, it will go straight into the<br>
						ground, which is how you'll know you've found it. At that point, dig straight down until you're in the Stronghold<br>
						(shown below).</p>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft360/images/5/50/Stronghold.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20140303205214" height="240"
						width="240" alt="Stronghold" />
						
						<p>Once you're in the Stronghold, your goal is to find the portal room (shown below). The portal consists of 12 slots<br>
						that must be filled with Eyes of Ender in order to activate. Each slot has a 10% chance of already being filled.<br>
						Like the Nether Fortress, Strongholds contain valuable loot. Often, in the chests that lie scattered about the<br>
						stronghold, you'll find ender pearls, which you can use to fill the portal. One of the most valuable rooms you'll<br>
						find is the library, where two chests are always to be found. These chests contain enchantment books which often<br>
						have enchantments that'll make fighting the dragon significantly easier.</p>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft/images/7/78/EndPortalRoom.png/revision/latest?cb=20190916231654" height="240" width="240" alt="Portal room" />
					</span>
					
					<span id="fightingTheDragon">
						<h3 class="subsectionTitle">Fighting the Dragon</h3>
						<p>The duration of the dragon fight varies depending on luck. Sometimes, it likes to be fly around far away in<br>
						the sky while you wait helplessly for it to return to the center of the large island. Other times, it stays in<br>
						the center doing absolutely nothing while you bash it relentlessly with an axe, or blow it up with beds.<br>
						Beds blow up in dimensions that aren't the overworld, which is something that you can take advantage of<br>
						if your intention is to kill the dragon as quickly as possible. Regardless of what you intend to do, your<br>
						first course of action will always be to destroy each of the 10 crystals that heal the dragon using a bow<br>
						and arrow. As you're doing this, the dragon will shoot fireballs at you that leave a lingering pool of<br>
						damage in the spot that they land on. As mentioned before, the dragon will use its wings to fling you<br>
						into the sky, but you can use a water bucket to break your fall if you've got the timing down. Endermen<br>
						cannot touch water, so if you're being overwhelmed by them, you can also use your waterbucket to create<br>
						a sort of barrier that they have no way to breach.</p>
